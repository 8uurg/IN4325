# Core IR lectures

The following 8 lectures cover core IR topics.

## Lecture 1: evaluation

This lecture covers the basics of evaluation, a vital topic in IR - a research field driven forward by empirical work. For the core IR project, you need to have detailed knowledge of at least a small number of metrics, why they are used for a specific task, how to test whether treatment and control (or baseline vs. experimental approach) differ significantly, etc.

The slides  are [online](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRUZW8Xz2ib8IlJwUIpKucYYFZ5pzUSuoP57UfjwWyQuJil7GDcts50rsOacvV5q3pzhV_HEa69vuSH/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) - currently from the 2017/18 course edition. The slides will be updated (as needed) after the lecture.

### Recommended readings

- Chapter 8 of Manning's et al. Introduction to Information Retrieval book ([PDF](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/irbookonlinereading.pdf)).
Chapter 8 of Croft's et al. Search Engines - Information Retrieval in Practice book ([PDF](http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/downloads/SEIRiP.pdf)).

### Resources

- [trec_eval](https://github.com/usnistgov/trec_eval)
- A good [tutorial](http://ir.cis.udel.edu/ICTIR13tutorial/) on statistical significance testing with an R worksheet by Ben Carterette.
- A detailed read on test collections: *Test Collection Based Evaluation of Information Retrieval Systems* by Mark Sanderson ([PDF](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.646.8451&rep=rep1&type=pdf)).

- A recent [A/B testing tutorial](https://exp-platform.com/2017abtestingtutorial/) by Pavel Dmitriev.

## Lecture 2: classic retrieval models

This lecture covers the most well-known retrieval models in IR - starting from the boolean model and ending at the language modeling approach to IR. More advanced retrieval models (learning to rank and neural approaches to IR) will be covered in lectures 7 and 8 of this course.

The slides  are [online](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQFLHSedV4X00-vLhTNbV0aX7zklIM0rosjsYRCyMnurfEOilb4MBVUrTCjpVu0A6yink3czArmBvNp/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) - currently from the 2017/18 course edition. The slides will be updated (as needed) after the lecture.

### Recommended readings

- Chapters 11.1-11.3 and 12.1-12.3 of Manning's et al. Introduction to Information Retrieval book ([PDF](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/pdf/irbookonlinereading.pdf)).
- Chapter 7.1-7.3 of Croft's et al. Search Engines - Information Retrieval in Practice book ([PDF](http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/downloads/SEIRiP.pdf)).
  
### Resources

- A [critical review](http://times.cs.uiuc.edu/czhai/pub/slmir-now.pdf) of Language Models for IR by ChengXiang Zhai.
- Victor Lavrenko (one of the language modeling pioneers in IR) has a lot of useful [lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/victorlavrenko/videos) on YouTube about language models and more general IR and machine learning concepts.
