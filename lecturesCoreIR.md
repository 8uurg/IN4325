# Core IR lectures

The following 8 lectures cover core IR topics.

## Lecture 1: evaluation

This lecture covers the basics of evaluation, a vital topic in IR - a research field driven forward by empirical work. For the core IR project, you need to have detailed knowledge of at least a small number of metrics, why they are used for a specific task, how to test whether treatment and control (or baseline vs. experimental approach) differ significantly, etc.

The slides  are [online](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRUZW8Xz2ib8IlJwUIpKucYYFZ5pzUSuoP57UfjwWyQuJil7GDcts50rsOacvV5q3pzhV_HEa69vuSH/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) - currently the 2017/18 version. The slides will be updated (as needed) after the lecture.
