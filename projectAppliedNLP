# Applied NLP project

There are three expected outputs:

1. **Project proposal** (mandatory, but ungraded - you will receive feedback).
2. **Intermediate project report** (mandatory, but ungraded - you will receive feedback).
3. **Final project report** (mandatory, graded).

**Group projects are conducted in groups of 3-4 students. Please enroll together with your team members in group on Brightspace - we have predefined 40 different groups, take your pick!**

You can choose between two types of projects: reproducing an NLP paper or investigating a research idea of your own.

## 1. Reproducing an NLP paper


### List of recommended NLP papers

## 2. Investigating a research idea of your own choice

## Restrictions

Based on prior experience we put the following restrictions on your choice of project, no matter if you reproduce a paper or follow your own research idea:

- **You can only conduct a project on neural NLP if you have succesfully completed the Deep Learning course beforehand.**
- The main focus of your project is *NLP*. If you build a classifier, the features you study should be motivated by linguistic theory/previous findings in NLP.
- If you use off the self solutions: be aware of the defaults and motivate why they are suitable for your problem.
- Not all data is created equal -- what kind of biases might come from the dataset you are using?
- The project focuses on **textual data** (not video/audio/genomics/.... data).

We have a first deadline in week 3.6, so you will get early feedback on the suitability of your proposal.

## Report formats
(These are the same as for core IR.)

### Project proposal

The proposal should contain between 300 and 400 words. Your proposal should address the following points:

1. Problem description: which problem will you tackle and what is interesting about the problem? If you reproduce a paper make sure to reference the original paper.
2. Resources: which data and tools will you be using (this includes also existing implementations of algorithms
3. Methodology: if you choose to reproduce a paper, tell us which part of the paper (if not all) you will reproduce; if you choose your own research idea, tell us what type of algorithm/approach you are proposing and what your baseline(s) will be
4. Background readings: list at least 5 related papers that you will read to add context to your research
5. Evaluation: how will you evaluate your algorithm/approach? Which evaluation metrics will you use?

**Submission**: every group uploads their proposal on Brightspace. The proposal should be in PDF format and should contain the group name and the list of group members (name, student IDs).

**Feedback**: the course team will provide feedback on the project proposal within a few days.

### Intermediate and final project report

The **final** group project report should be **7-8 pages** long in the [SIGCHI proceedings format](https://sigchi.org/templates/) (available as LaTeX and Word templates). The **intermediate** project report is likely to be shorter (it is due a week before the final deadline), that is fine, submit whatever you have by then.

We suggest the following report structure:

- Title, authors
- Abstract
- Introduction: problem statement, motivation for the problem, overall plan to tackle the problem
- Background: what important works does this project build on
- Approach: what methods/algorithms did you use
- Experiments: describe your experiments, the results and discuss them
- Conclusions: describe what you learnt/found and what avenues for future work you see
- References

The final report should also contain a link to a repository (or several) that contain the software you created, the scripts you used to analyze your data, etc.

Submission: every group uploads their intermediate and final group project reports on Brightspace. The reports should be in PDF format. Note that after submission a plagiarism check is executed by Turnitin - please make sure to follow the academic rules of writing ([you can read them up here one more time](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/actuele-themas/copyright/c/plagiarism/)).

The final project report is graded in combination with the project interview. The interview will be an academic discussion about the executed project.

## Interviews

The 15 minute interviews per group will be scheduled on **April 11** and **April 12**.
